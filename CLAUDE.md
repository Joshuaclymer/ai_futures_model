# STANDARDS
- The priority is to make the code easy to read. Use descriptive variable names and explain the logic of what you are doing in comments. But don't add comments unless they are actually helpful for understanding what the code is doing.
- Pay attention to code quality and organization (though don't deviate from the organization described in the README unless I ask you to)
