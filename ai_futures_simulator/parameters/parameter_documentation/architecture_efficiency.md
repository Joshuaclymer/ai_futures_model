# Architecture Efficiency

Chip performance improves through two mechanisms: increased transistor density and improved chip architecture. This parameter captures architecture improvements—performance gains from design optimization rather than transistor scaling.

According to [Epoch's data](https://epoch.ai/blog/trends-in-machine-learning-hardware), total chip performance (TPP per die area) has improved at approximately 1.55x per year:

Transistor density has increased at approximately 1.26x per year:

The ratio (1.55 / 1.26 = **1.23x per year**) represents architecture improvements alone.
