| 5% | Median percentage error in US estimates of PRC datacenter energy consumption |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter captures how precisely US intelligence can estimate China's datacenter energy consumption. Covert datacenters consume significant energy, so if the US can accurately estimate total datacenter energy usage, large covert operations become harder to hide because the energy discrepancy would be detectable.

To calibrate this parameter, we looked at historical intelligence estimates of the sizes of adversary weapons stockpiles, which show median errors of around 15%. Energy consumption differs from weapons counts in ways that may make it somewhat easier to estimate.

US intelligence can estimate energy consumption through multiple independent methods: satellite imagery of power plants, trade data for fuel imports, economic modeling, and grid infrastructure analysis. These redundant methods can cross-validate each other. However, China's grid is complex with many industrial facilities, and attributing energy to specific facilities (especially hidden ones) is challenging. Covert facilities might also use off-grid power sources such as local generation or solar to reduce their energy signatures.

We estimate US intelligence has approximately 5% median error in estimating PRC datacenter energy consumption—better than for weapons counts but not dramatically so, given the challenges of attribution in a complex industrial economy.
