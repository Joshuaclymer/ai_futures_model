**How we chose this parameter**

See the documentation for [mean_detection_time_for_100_workers](/parameter_docs/perceptions_parameters/mean_detection_time_for_100_workers/mean_detection_time_for_100_workers.md) for full details on the detection time model. The value for 1,000 workers is derived from the same fitted relationship between workforce size and detection time.
