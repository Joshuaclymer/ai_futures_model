# state_of_the_art_energy_efficiency_improvement_per_year

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1.35x per year | Annual improvement in energy efficiency (FLOPS per watt) for state-of-the-art ML hardware |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter captures how quickly the energy efficiency of AI chips improves over time. More efficient chips require less power for the same compute, which affects both the energy requirements and thermal signatures of datacenters.

According to Epoch AI's analysis of ML hardware energy efficiency trends, state-of-the-art chips have improved at approximately 1.35x per year in FLOPS per watt. This improvement comes from both transistor scaling (smaller transistors switch faster with less energy) and architecture improvements (better chip designs extract more useful compute per transistor operation).
