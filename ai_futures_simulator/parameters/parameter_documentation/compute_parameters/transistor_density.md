# Transistor Density

Transistor density depends on process node—the resolution at which circuits are etched onto silicon. Smaller nodes increase transistor count per chip, yielding more compute per wafer.

The chart shows H100-equivalents producible per wafer at different process nodes (assuming 28 H100-sized chips per wafer). Moving from 28nm to 7nm approximately quadruples output.
