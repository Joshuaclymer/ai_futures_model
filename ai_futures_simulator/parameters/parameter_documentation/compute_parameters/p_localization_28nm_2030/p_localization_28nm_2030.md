| 25% | Probability that China achieves >90% domestic sourcing for 28nm semiconductor manufacturing equipment by 2030 |

**How we chose this parameter**

A covert fab must use primarily domestic equipment to avoid detection through procurement records, since the semiconductor equipment market has few buyers and sellers and missing equipment from China's declared chip industry would be conspicuous. This parameter represents the probability that China achieves sufficient domestic sourcing capability to build a fab without importing most equipment.

As of 2025, China can manufacture 130nm chips using approximately 80% domestic equipment. Advanced nodes still require imports, particularly photolithography scanners. By 2030, we estimate a 25% probability that China achieves >90% localization at 28nm. SMEE and Huawei are developing DUV immersion scanners that would be critical for this capability.

For more advanced nodes, the probabilities are lower: approximately 10% for 14nm (which requires multi-patterning using 28nm scanners) and approximately 6% for 7nm (which requires either EUV or aggressive multi-patterning). These estimates reflect both the technical challenges and the urgency created by US export controls, which have increased China's investment in domestic production. The government has committed $47.5B specifically to semiconductor equipment, and Chinese companies are offering salaries reaching 3x ASML compensation to recruit talent.
