# us_frontier_project_compute_tpp_h100e_in_2025

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 100,000 H100-equivalents | Compute stock available to the largest US AI project in 2025 |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter represents the compute capacity of the largest US frontier AI project, used as a reference point for comparing black project compute accumulation. It was adapted from the AI Futures Project's timelines model, which tracks announced and estimated compute deployments at major AI labs.

The value represents effective training compute in H100-equivalent units, accounting for differences in chip architectures and interconnect efficiency across different deployments.
