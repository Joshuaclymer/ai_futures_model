# h100_sized_chips_per_wafer

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 28 chips | Number of usable H100-equivalent chips produced per silicon wafer |

**How we chose this parameter**

TSMC produces approximately 28 usable H100 chips per silicon wafer. This yield figure is from [TrendForce (March 2024)](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/03/18/news-tsmc-boosts-investment-in-advanced-packaging-with-ntd-500-billion-plan-to-build-six-plants-in-chiayi-science-park/).

This serves as our baseline for converting wafer production to chip counts. The actual yield depends on defect rates, die size, and edge effects on the circular wafer, but 28 represents TSMC's achieved yield for H100 production.
