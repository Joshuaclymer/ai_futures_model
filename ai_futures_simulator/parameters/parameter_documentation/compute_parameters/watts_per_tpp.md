# Watts per Transistor Performance Product

Energy efficiency improves with smaller process nodes, but the relationship changed after Dennard scaling ended around 2006.

- **Before 2006:** W/TPP ∝ (density)^-0.5
- **After 2006:** W/TPP ∝ (density)^-0.15

This means modern chips are more power-hungry per transistor than earlier generations predicted.
