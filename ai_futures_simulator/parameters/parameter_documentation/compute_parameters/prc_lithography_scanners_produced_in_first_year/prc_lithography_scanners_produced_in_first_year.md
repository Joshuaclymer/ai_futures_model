# PRC Scanner Production Ramp-Up

This parameter models the rate at which China could scale domestic lithography scanner production. We estimated this from ASML's historical production ramp-up for each scanner generation after achieving high-volume manufacturing:

The trendline shows typical ramp-up trajectory. We assume China's domestic scanner production would follow a similar pattern.
