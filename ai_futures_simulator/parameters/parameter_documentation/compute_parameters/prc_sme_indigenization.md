## Relevance to detection

The semiconductor equipment market has few buyers and sellers. Missing equipment from China's declared chip industry would be conspicuous. A covert fab must therefore use primarily domestic equipment to avoid detection through procurement records.

These parameters represent the probability that China achieves >90% domestic sourcing for semiconductor manufacturing equipment at each process node by the specified year.

## Current status (2025)

China can manufacture 130nm chips using approximately 80% domestic equipment. Advanced nodes still require imports—particularly photolithography scanners.

## Projected capabilities by 2031

- **28nm:** ~25% probability of >90% localization. SMEE and Huawei are developing DUV immersion scanners.
- **14nm:** ~10% probability. Requires multi-patterning using 28nm scanners.
- **7nm:** ~6% probability. Requires either EUV or aggressive multi-patterning.

## Driving factors

- US export controls have increased urgency for domestic production
- Government commitment of $47.5B specifically to semiconductor equipment
- Aggressive talent recruitment (salaries reaching 3x ASML compensation)
