# total_prc_compute_tpp_h100e_in_2025

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 500,000 H100-equivalents | Total AI compute capacity across all PRC datacenters in 2025 |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter represents the total capacity of AI-capable compute in Chinese datacenters that were not deliberately designed for stealth. This serves as the baseline from which compute might be diverted to a covert project.

The estimate includes both domestically-produced chips and imported hardware (including chips obtained despite export controls). It represents total installed capacity, not the portion controlled by any single organization.
