# MW per Construction Worker per Year

This parameter specifies datacenter construction rate per worker. We estimated this rate from publicly reported datacenter construction projects:

## Secrecy overhead

Covert construction requires additional time. Comparing declared versus undeclared nuclear enrichment facilities shows undeclared facilities took approximately 1.5x longer (5.5 years vs 3.7 years average). Applying this factor reduces the effective construction rate from ~0.2 MW to ~0.13 MW per worker per year.
