# data_center_mw_per_operating_worker

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0.5 MW/worker | Datacenter capacity that each operations worker can support |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter is a project property rather than a fixed physical constant—it represents a strategic choice about staffing levels that affects both operating costs and detection risk. More workers per MW of capacity may improve operations but increases the risk of leaks.

The value of 0.5 MW per operating worker is based on industry data for large-scale datacenter operations, where automation and standardization allow relatively small teams to manage substantial compute capacity.
