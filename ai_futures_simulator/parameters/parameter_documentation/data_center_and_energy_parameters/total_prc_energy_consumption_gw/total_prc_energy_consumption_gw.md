| 1,000 GW | China's average electricity consumption (approximate continuous power draw) |

**How we chose this parameter**

China's total electricity consumption provides context for covert datacenter concealment. A facility consuming 0.1% of national electricity is more concealable than one consuming 1%. This parameter sets the denominator for calculating what fraction of national energy a covert datacenter would consume.

China consumed approximately 8,700 TWh of electricity in 2023, which translates to an average continuous power draw of roughly 1,000 GW. This provides the reference against which covert datacenter energy consumption is measured.
