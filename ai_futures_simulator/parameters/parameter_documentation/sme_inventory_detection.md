# SME Inventory Detection

US intelligence could detect a covert fab by identifying discrepancies between China's declared semiconductor manufacturing equipment and their estimates. Detection probability depends on two factors:

## 1. Diversion fraction

Large diversions are conspicuous. Diverting 80 of 100 scanners would be obvious; a small fraction might remain within estimation error.

## 2. Estimation precision

If US estimates have wide error bars (e.g., "50–150 DUV scanners"), small discrepancies are indistinguishable from noise. Precise estimates make even small diversions detectable.

## Historical context

Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.

## Equipment vs. weapons

China's semiconductor industry is quasi-private with some investor visibility, and the equipment supply chain is extensive. We estimate US intelligence error at approximately 7%—roughly 2x better than for weapons programs.
