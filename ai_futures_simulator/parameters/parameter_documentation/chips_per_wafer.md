# Chips per Wafer (Yield)

TSMC produces approximately 28 usable H100 chips per silicon wafer. This yield figure is from [TrendForce (March 2024)](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/03/18/news-tsmc-boosts-investment-in-advanced-packaging-with-ntd-500-billion-plan-to-build-six-plants-in-chiayi-science-park/).

This serves as our baseline for converting wafer production to chip counts.
