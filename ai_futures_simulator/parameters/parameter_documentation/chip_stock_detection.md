# Chip Stock Detection Parameters

US intelligence could detect a covert project by identifying discrepancies between China's reported AI chip stock and their estimates. Detection probability depends on two factors:

## 1. Diversion fraction

Larger diversions are easier to detect. Diverting 50% of AI chips would be conspicuous; diverting 5% might remain within estimation error.

## 2. Estimation precision

If US estimates have wide error bars (e.g., "800K–1.2M H100-equivalents"), small discrepancies are indistinguishable from noise. Precise estimates make even small diversions detectable.

## Historical context

Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.

## AI chips vs. weapons

AI chips flow through a highly specialized supply chain that may be easier to monitor than weapons programs. We estimate US intelligence error at approximately 7%—roughly half the historical weapons estimate error.
