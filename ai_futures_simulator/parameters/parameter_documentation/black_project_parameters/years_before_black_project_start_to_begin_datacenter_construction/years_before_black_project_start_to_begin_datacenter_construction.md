# years_before_black_project_start_to_begin_datacenter_construction

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 2 years | How many years before the black project officially starts that covert datacenter construction begins |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter specifies how many years before an international AI agreement China begins constructing covert datacenters. If both governments recognize the strategic importance of AI development, preparation for potential agreements—including covert infrastructure—could precede formal negotiations by months or years.

The default of 2 years reflects a scenario where China anticipates potential constraints on AI development and begins building infrastructure in advance, balancing the benefits of early preparation against the risks of premature detection.
