# Maximum Energy Proportion

This parameter specifies the maximum proportion of PRC energy consumption that can be used for covert datacenters without raising suspicion.

If covert datacenter energy consumption exceeds this proportion, the risk of detection through energy accounting anomalies increases significantly.
