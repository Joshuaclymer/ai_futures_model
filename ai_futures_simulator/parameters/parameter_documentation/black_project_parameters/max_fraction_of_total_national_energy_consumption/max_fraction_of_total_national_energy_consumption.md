# max_fraction_of_total_national_energy_consumption

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0.5% | Maximum proportion of China's total energy consumption that covert datacenters can use without raising suspicion |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter specifies the maximum proportion of PRC energy consumption that can be used for covert datacenters without raising suspicion through energy accounting anomalies. China's total electricity consumption is approximately 1,000 GW on average, so 0.5% corresponds to roughly 5 GW of covert datacenter capacity.

Exceeding this threshold significantly increases the risk of detection as the energy demand becomes harder to hide within normal industrial variation and harder to attribute to legitimate uses.
