# total_labor

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 10,000 workers | Total workforce allocated to the covert project |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter is a project property—a strategic choice that affects both the project's capabilities and its detection risk. More workers enable faster construction and operation of covert infrastructure, but larger workforces increase the probability of leaks and detection.

The default value represents a balance between operational capacity and security. Historical data from covert nuclear programs suggests that projects with fewer than 1,000 workers can maintain secrecy for extended periods, while projects with more than 10,000 workers face significantly higher detection risk.
