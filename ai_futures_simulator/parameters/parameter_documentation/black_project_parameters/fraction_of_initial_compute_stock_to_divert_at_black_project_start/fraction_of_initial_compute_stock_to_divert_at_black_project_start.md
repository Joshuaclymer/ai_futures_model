# fraction_of_initial_compute_stock_to_divert_at_black_project_start

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 10% | Fraction of China's AI chip stock diverted to the covert project at the start |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter specifies the fraction of AI chips that are diverted from declared usage to the covert project when it begins. Larger diversions provide more compute capacity but increase the risk of detection through chip stock accounting discrepancies.

The default of 10% represents a moderate approach that provides meaningful compute while staying within the range where discrepancies might plausibly be attributed to estimation error in US intelligence assessments.
