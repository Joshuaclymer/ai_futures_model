# black_fab_min_process_node

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 28nm | Minimum process node achievable by a covert fab using domestic Chinese equipment |

**How we chose this parameter**

This parameter specifies the most advanced process node that a covert fab could achieve using primarily domestic Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Using imported equipment would create procurement records that could expose the covert operation.

As of 2025, China's domestic equipment capability is most mature at 28nm, with higher probabilities of achieving full supply chain independence at this node than at more advanced nodes. A covert fab at 28nm would produce chips with lower performance and energy efficiency than state-of-the-art western chips, but would be manufacturable without detectable equipment imports.
