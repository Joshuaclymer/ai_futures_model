# fraction_of_datacenter_capacity_not_built_for_concealment_to_divert_at_black_project_start

| Modal value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 50% | Proportion of existing (unconcealed) datacenter capacity redirected to covert operations |

**How we chose this parameter**

When a covert project begins, it may not have time to construct purpose-built concealed facilities. Instead, it can repurpose existing datacenter infrastructure: commercial datacenters can be commandeered or have portions allocated to government use, government facilities may have spare capacity that can be redirected, and research institutions like universities and national labs have computing resources that could be reallocated.

These facilities were not designed for concealment, making them more vulnerable to satellite and energy-based detection methods. The trade-off is that they offer immediate availability, proven infrastructure, and existing operational expertise, while carrying higher detection risk.

The 50% default reflects a moderate scenario where the covert project needs substantial compute quickly, but complete commandeering of all facilities would be too conspicuous. A balance is struck between capability and concealment.
