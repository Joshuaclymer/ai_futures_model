# Energy Efficiency Exponent (Post-2006)

Energy efficiency scales with transistor density according to a power law:

```
W/TPP ∝ (transistor density)^exponent
```

After Dennard scaling ended (~2006), voltage could no longer decrease with transistor size. The exponent became less negative, reducing efficiency gains from further miniaturization.
