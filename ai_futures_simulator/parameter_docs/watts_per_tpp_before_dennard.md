# Energy Efficiency Exponent (Pre-2006)

Energy efficiency scales with transistor density according to a power law:

```
W/TPP ∝ (transistor density)^exponent
```

Before Dennard scaling ended (~2006), voltage decreased with transistor size, enabling substantial efficiency gains—the exponent was strongly negative.
