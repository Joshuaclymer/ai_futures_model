I've scanned the codebase and updated `code_cleanliness_status.md` with my findings. Here's a summary of what I found:

**Key Updates:**

1. **Inline styles** - Updated the existing entry with more detail: found 116 occurrences across 17 files. The worst offenders are:
   - DatacenterSection.tsx (34 inline styles)
   - CovertFabSection (27)
   - InitialStockSection (17)
   - Tooltip (10)

2. **New backend issues identified:**
   - 2 TODO comments in `black_project_simulation.py` (lines 256 and 266)
   - `sys.path.insert` used in 12+ files - fragile path manipulation that could benefit from proper Python packaging

3. **New issues section** added with:
   - **Low priority:** Hardcoded absolute paths in scripts, untracked pycache files showing in git status
   - **Medium priority:** The sys.path manipulation pattern and the high inline style count in DatacenterSection

**Current state:**
- CSS file reduced from 1284 to 792 lines (improvement complete)
- Section files are under the 1000-line limit but trending upward (CovertFabSection at 707 lines)
- Many improvements already completed from previous scans
