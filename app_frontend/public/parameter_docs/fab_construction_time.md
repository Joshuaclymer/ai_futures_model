# Fab Construction Time

Chip fabrication plants typically require 1–3 years from groundbreaking to first production, depending on capacity:

## Secrecy overhead

Covert construction requires additional time. Comparing declared versus undeclared nuclear enrichment facilities shows undeclared facilities took approximately 1.5x longer (5.5 years vs 3.7 years average). Applying this factor to chip fabs yields estimated covert construction times of 1.5–4.5 years:

## Labor constraints

McKinsey estimates fab construction requires approximately 100 workers per billion dollars of cost. Understaffing extends construction proportionally; overstaffing provides diminishing returns due to parallelization limits.
