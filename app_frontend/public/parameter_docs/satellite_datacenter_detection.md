# Satellite Datacenter Detection

US intelligence could detect a covert project by identifying discrepancies between China's declared datacenter capacity and satellite-based estimates. Detection probability depends on two factors:

## 1. Diversion fraction

The PRC may divert existing datacenter capacity (not built for concealment) to the covert project. Large diversions are conspicuous; small diversions might remain within estimation error.

## 2. Satellite estimation precision

If satellite-based estimates have wide error bars, small discrepancies are indistinguishable from noise. High-resolution satellite imagery and thermal signatures can improve precision, making even small diversions detectable.

## Historical context

Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.

## Datacenters vs. weapons

Physical datacenter infrastructure is relatively easy to observe from space using thermal signatures and facility layouts. We estimate satellite-based datacenter capacity estimates have approximately 1% median error.
