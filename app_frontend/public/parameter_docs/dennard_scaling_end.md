# Dennard Scaling End

Dennard scaling—the principle that smaller transistors use proportionally less power—enabled decades of efficiency improvements. As transistors shrank, operating voltages could decrease, allowing more transistors without increased power consumption.

Around 2006, this relationship broke down as voltages approached physical limits. The chart below shows this inflection point:

This parameter specifies the transistor density (millions per mm²) at which Dennard scaling ended.
