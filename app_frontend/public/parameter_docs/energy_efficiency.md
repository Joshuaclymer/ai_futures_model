# Energy Efficiency Relative to H100

This multiplier represents the energy efficiency of China's chips relative to an H100:

- **0.5**: Chinese chips consume twice the energy per unit of compute
- **1.0**: Equivalent efficiency to H100
- **2.0**: Twice as efficient as H100

This parameter converts H100-equivalent compute to actual power consumption.
