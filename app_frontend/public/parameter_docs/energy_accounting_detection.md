# Energy Accounting Detection

US intelligence could detect covert datacenters by identifying discrepancies between China's total energy consumption and accounted-for energy usage. Detection probability depends on two factors:

## 1. Covert energy consumption

Covert datacenters consume significant energy. The larger the covert datacenter capacity, the larger the energy discrepancy that must be hidden or explained away.

## 2. Energy estimation precision

If US estimates of PRC energy consumption have wide error bars, covert datacenter energy usage might be indistinguishable from estimation noise. Precise energy tracking makes large covert operations more detectable.

## Historical context

Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.

## Energy vs. weapons

Energy consumption can be estimated through satellite imagery of power plants, trade data, and economic modeling. We estimate US intelligence has approximately 7% median error in estimating PRC datacenter energy consumption.
